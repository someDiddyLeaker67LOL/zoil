its pretty easy you just need to sign in your apple id a couple times on pc and have device plugged into pc.
altstore Needs iTunes and iCloud to work

once Altstore is installed on device sideload the zoilLOL.ipa file and it should work


Altstore apps are not permanent IF not in the EU, this app was made for fun and the biggest twitch streamer EVER and wasnt meant for everyday use anyways
